## Welcome to Maths Models.

I’ve always loved Maths and after a 30 year IT career following Uni I decided to train as a Maths teacher and spend the rest of my working life pursuing my hobby.

The area of the subject I prefer is Applied Maths: using the subject to explain and investigate real world objects and systems.  Being a Maths teacher has given me a wonderful opportunity to indulge this subject, and hopefully inspire some pupils, by building a variety of physical mathematical models with students.  These are often backed up with computerised simulations and always with lots of maths describing and explaining aspects of the models we’ve built.

This website collects together information on the models along with descriptions of some of the maths, and links to simulations built.

I hope you find the site interesting.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions and do share with friends who also have the maths bug.
