## What is a Sierpinski Tetrahedron?

A Sierpinski tetrahedron is a 3D version of the Sierpinski triangle.

A Sierpinski triangle is a fractal based on an equilateral triangle, made by divising the trangle into four smaller triangles, removing the central triangle and then repeating for each of the three remaing triangles.  If you repeat this process forever, you get a fractal.  

It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpiński.

## What is a fractal?

A fractal is a never ending pattern that repeats itself at different scales.  This property is called "Self-Similarity".  Although fractals are very complex they are made by repeating a simple process.

We find fractals in nature such as branching patterns like trees, river networks, lightning bolts and blood vessels.
