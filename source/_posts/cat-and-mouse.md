<h2>The problem</h2>

A mouse is at the centre of a circular pond. A cat who wants to eat the mouse is at the edge. The mouse can run faster than the cat, but can only swim at ¼ of the speed the cat can run. The cat will not enter the water.

Can the mouse escape the cat? How?

What path should it take to escape most quickly?


<h2>The solution</h2>

There’s no physical model with this puzzle, but lower down is a link to a model in GeoGebra that illustrates the solution.  I particularly like the puzzle as it is solvable without using anything other than basic maths, but to find the optimum escape path uses a mix of techniques that is a nice challenge for A level maths students.
