Thereâ€™s no physical model with this puzzle, but lower down is a link to a model in GeoGebra that illustrates the solution.  I particularly like the puzzle as it is solvable without using anything other than basic maths, but to find the optimum escape path uses a mix of techniques that is a nice challenge for A level maths students.
