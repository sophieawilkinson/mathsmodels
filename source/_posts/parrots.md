This small project was really a bit of downtime for my Year 10 class following their summer exams.  

Tessellation is the name for a picture created by ‘tiling’ one or more images onto a 2D surface in a regular pattern whereby the surface is completely covered (no gaps between the images).

Such pictures can look stunning and on first sight can appear very surprising.

M C Escher was a master exponent who created many amazing tessellated pictures, some bases on animals.  Ours is in a similar style.

The picture was made by copying the basic tessellation tile (a parrot) onto overhead projector slides, which the class cut out.

These were coloured with permanent marker pens and stuck onto my classroom window with PVA glue, which goes transparent when dry and exposed to ultra violet light.

Over a few weeks the pen colour was badly faded by sunlight so a second coat of colour, this time of glass paints, was applied by my tutor group.
